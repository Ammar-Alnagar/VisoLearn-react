```

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd VisoLearn-react
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```

   > **Security Note:** Ensure `.env` is included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits of sensitive credentials.

4. **Run the Application:**

   Start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start playing the game.

## Configuration Options

When starting a new game, you can customize several settings via the user interface:

- **Topic:** Define the subject or theme that the generated image should represent (e.g., "a futuristic city", "a cute animal").
- **Difficulty:** Choose from easy, medium, or hard to adjust image complexity and challenge level.
- **Style:** Specify an artistic style such as realistic, cartoon, or abstract.
- **Age (Optional):** Optionally, set a user age value to tailor content for age-appropriate experiences.
- **Attempts:** Configure the maximum number of attempts allowed per game session.
- **Win Threshold:** Set the minimum number of correctly guessed features required for a win.

## Gemini API Integration

VisoLearn integrates with the Gemini AI model for multiple functionalities:

- **Image Generation:** Uses the Gemini Pro Vision model to generate images dynamically based on user-defined prompts.
- **Feature Extraction:** Leverages Gemini to extract key visual features from the image description, enhancing gameplay by dynamically setting guessing targets.
- **Hint Generation:** Provides real-time, context-aware hints through a conversational interface powered by Gemini.

These integrations are implemented in the `app/utils/gemini.server.ts` file. The application employs robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure a smooth user experience even if dynamic generation fails.

## Development Notes

- **Remix Framework:** The application uses the Remix framework which handles both server and client rendering. The entry points are defined in `entry.client.tsx` and `entry.server.tsx`.
- **State Management:** Game state is maintained in React state and persisted to local storage, enabling session resumption and offline continuity.
- **Tailwind CSS:** All styling is built using Tailwind CSS, making it easy to customize the look and feel.
- **Logging and Debugging:** Extensive logging is included in critical areas (e.g., loading game state, API interactions) to simplify debugging and development.

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication:** Integrate user accounts and persistent game progress storage using a backend database.
- **Advanced Image Analysis:** Employ more sophisticated image processing techniques to further refine feature extraction.
- **Expanded Customization:** Offer more granular game settings and additional difficulty modes for a personalized experience.
- **Cross-model Integration:** Explore the incorporation of additional AI models to enhance interactivity and feature set.
- **Enhanced UI/UX:** Continually improve the user interface and responsiveness, incorporating user feedback.
